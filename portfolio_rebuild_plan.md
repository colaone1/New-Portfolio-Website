## 0. Strategic Integration of External Resources

### From [Sam's Portfolio Website](https://github.com/colaone1/Sam-s-Portfolio-Website-)
- **Content & Assets:**
  - Import project data, images, and content structure for About, Projects, and Blog sections during initial page implementation.
- **Accessibility & Performance Techniques:**
  - Reference previous accessibility solutions (skip links, ARIA, focus management) and performance optimizations (image handling, code splitting) during component and layout development.
- **Testing Results:**
  - Use prior cross-browser, accessibility, and performance test results as benchmarks for new implementation.

### From [Open-Source-Testing-Setup](https://github.com/colaone1/Open-Source-Testing-Setup)
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Integrate automated testing tools (e.g., Vitest, Playwright, axe) after core JavaScript and primary components are in place.
- **Accessibility & Performance Monitoring:**
  - Set up continuous accessibility and performance checks early in the development process and before deployment.

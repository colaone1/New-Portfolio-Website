# IMPORTANT: Code Development Guidelines

## Core Principle

**DO NOT GENERATE CODE FROM SCRATCH USING AI**

## Development Approach

1. Always build upon existing code
2. Preserve and enhance existing implementations
3. Maintain original code structure
4. Keep existing performance optimizations
5. Preserve accessibility features

## When Making Changes

1. First, locate and analyze the existing code
2. Understand the current implementation
3. Make incremental improvements
4. Preserve the original architecture
5. Maintain backward compatibility

## Code Sources

- Original portfolio website code
- Existing implementations
- Proven solutions
- Tested and verified code

## Why This Matters

- Maintains code consistency
- Preserves existing functionality
- Ensures reliability
- Keeps performance optimizations
- Maintains accessibility features

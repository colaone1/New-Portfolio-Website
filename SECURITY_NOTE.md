# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE

**NEVER PUSH SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO GIT OR GITHUB!**

- Do NOT commit `.env` files, API keys, database credentials, JWT secrets, or any other secrets.
- Always add these files to your `.gitignore`.
- If you accidentally commit secrets, rotate them immediately and clean your git history.
- Treat your repository as public, even if it is private.

_Protect your users, your data, and your project integrity!_
